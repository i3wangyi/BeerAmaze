## May 6th

1. Add monster behavior(move around somewhere)
2. Make some pictures for the first scene as help, perfect the GUI texture
3. Add a complete maze into our first scene, add more coins, mushrooms and monsters
4. Add a beer bottle at the exit, once the player collides with the beer, the game finishes, and the calculated points will be placed at the center of the screen.
5. (For expo), we need to have a big poster introducing the project
